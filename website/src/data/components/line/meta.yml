    Line chart with stacking ability.

    Given an array of data series having an id and a nested array of points
    (with x, y properties), it will compute the line for each data serie.
    All datum having null x or y will be treated as holes, thus portions
    of the corresponding line will be skipped.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveLine`.

    This component is available in the `@x-nivo/api`, see
    [sample](api:/samples/line.svg) or
    [try it using the API client](self:/line/api).

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.
