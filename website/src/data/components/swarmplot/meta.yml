    A swarm plot component which can also be used to make beeswarm plot
    when using a single data serie.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveSwarmPlot`.

SwarmPlotCanvas:
  package: '@nivo/swarmplot'
  tags:
    - canvas
  stories: []
  description: |
    A variation around the [SwarmPlot](self:/swarmplot) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveSwarmPlotCanvas`.
